Handwriting App Updates
I have updated the application to support A4 page formatting, automatic pagination, custom font sizing, and cursive-style letter spacing.

New Features
1. Letter Spacing (Cursive Mode)
Added a Spacing slider to the toolbar.
Positive values (e.g., 5, 10) creates wide spacing.
Negative values (e.g., -5, -10) causes characters to overlap, simulating cursive handwriting.

2. Font Size Control
Adjust text size from 20% to 80% with the Size slider.
Document automatically repaginates to fit the new size.

3. A4 Canvas Dimensions
The canvas is sized to 794px x 1123px (A4 at 96 DPI).
Perfect for PDF export.
Verification
Manual Verification
Cursive Effect: Move the "Spacing" slider to the left (negative). Verify letters touch each other.
Font Size: Move "Size" slider. Verify text grows/shrinks.
Pagination: Paste long text and use Next/Prev buttons to navigate.
